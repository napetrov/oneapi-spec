|dal_full_name| (|dal_short_name|) is a library that provides building blocks covering all stages of data analytics: data acquisition
from a data source, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, modeling, validation and decision making.

|dal_short_name| supports the concept of the end-to-end analytics when some of data analytics stages are performed on the
edge devices (close to where the data is generated and where it is finally consumed). Specifically,
|dal_short_name| Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are agnostic about a particular cross-device
communication technology and therefore can be used within different end-to-end analytics frameworks.

Library consists of the following major components:

- Data Management

- Algorithms
